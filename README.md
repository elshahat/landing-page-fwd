## Instructions

Open the index.html file in the browser to surf the landing page project. The project is consisting of an index.hml file, one .js file which is "app.js" located at the "js" folder, and a .css file which is "style.css" located at the "css" folder.
If you need to update any files, you have first to clone the project or download it from GitHub and then drag the project folder to your preferable IDE or code editor, I prefer WebStorm IDE as a paid option and VSCode as an open source code editor. Please get back to the Udacity classroom for more specific and in details instructions.

## Project Implementation

- Every section added to the HTML will build the main menu dynamically to reflect the number of sections and the name of every section in the main menu.
- The active section is viewed, and the related link in the main menu is highlighted.
- When clicking in any link from the main menu, the page will scroll to the requested section.
- While the page is scrolling the main menu will be hidden and reappear again after the user stop scrolling.
- A back to top button will be visible when the user starts to scroll to the bottom of the page and when he clicks on this button he will scroll to the top of the page again.
